Can you read the spec at dev-notes/2025-05-22-minimal-automation-chain-spec.md and then help me plan out the ECS aspects for this initial super minimal automation chain.

* Dont look at any of our code, as it is a bit rough.  I want to design this freshly before we look at integrating into the existing code. Just use the spec and lets plan it out.
* Lets fully map out the ECS aspects in minimal pseudocode before doing any real code.

Important: Let me know if you have any thoughts on how to improve it or questions to clarify first!! Confirm with me first before proceeding.

  ⎿  ☒ Read and analyze the minimal automation chain specification
     ☐ Design ECS component structure for mining drills and transport tubes
     ☐ Plan ECS systems for mining, transport, and connection logic
     ☐ Map out system execution order and timing mechanisms

⏺ Great! I've read the spec and understand the minimal automation chain. Before I dive into the ECS design, I have a few questions
  to clarify:

  Questions:

  1. Item Storage Approach: The spec mentions using counts only (not individual item entities). Should we store ironOreCount
  directly on the building components, or create separate Inventory components that can be attached to buildings?
  2. Timing/Ticks: Should we implement a global tick counter, or have each building track its own timers? The spec mentions "60
  ticks" and "30 ticks" - should these be hardcoded or configurable per building?
  3. Connection Detection: Should connections be calculated dynamically each tick, or cached/stored as relationships between
  entities?
  4. Entity Types: Should Mining Drills and Transport Tubes be different entity types with different component sets, or the same
  entity type with different component configurations?

  My Initial Thoughts:

  - Use separate components for Position, MiningDrill, TransportTube, Inventory, and Timer for maximum flexibility
  - Implement a global tick system with relative timers on each building
  - Cache connections as relationships to avoid recalculating every tick
  - Use component composition to distinguish building types

  Would you like me to proceed with this approach, or do you have different preferences for any of these design decisions?

----------------------------
*Me:*

* Item counts directly on buildings for now, no generic Inventory component yet
* Let's not worry too much about optimization of transport tubes for nwo. prefer simplicity over performance
* I think there should be a global tick counter right? I think that is the best practice? And then entities can have relative counters for their own timings?
* Component composition sounds good to me.

How does that sounds?

Once we are done hashing out these details, then we can update the spec and then start sketching out the ECS. But let me know you dont have any more questions and confirm with me before proceeding.
